Our semi-analytical results are\nfurther confirmed by spherically symmetric simulations of the\nGross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations. Inverting our obtained relations, we\nhighlight a degeneracy that could significantly affect constraints on the boson\nmass in the presence of repulsive boson self-interactions and propose the\nsimultaneous extraction of static and dynamical solitonic features as a way to\nuniquely constrain both the boson mass and self-interactions.",
